# üê± Cat Fact Fetcher

Hi! I'm Ishan Sawai ‚Äî a student at the National Institute of Technology Agartala who loves to build cool things with code, explore new technologies, and solve real-world problems one line at a time.

This project is a simple, responsive React app built using **Vite** for faster development. It fetches random cat facts from a public API using `async/await`. Clean UI, centered layout, and smooth styling with **Arial** font.

I'm very hardworking and eager to join your internship. I can commit **40 hours/week starting tomorrow**.  
Looking forward to hearing from you!
